2. Determine the **optimal number of groups**.
3. Label the groups for actionable insights.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python** (for data analysis and visualization)
- **Clustering Algorithms** (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Steps to Complete the Project
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing.
2. Visualize and understand the data distribution.
3. Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means).
4. Evaluate and choose the best segmentation.
